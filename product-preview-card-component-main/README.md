Started with the HTML first, and moved on to the styling with mobile first approach. After that I did the desktop design and everything was looking good and responsive.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media query

### What I learned

What I learned in this section is cool new ways to create and initialize a repository from command line plus recap of all the basic stuffs of HTML and CSS.



### Useful resources
