## Overview
This challenge needed to create the pixel perfect html + css design of a given figma wireframe.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process
1. Initialize a new project
2. Create the index template files for html css and javascript
3. Add markup for the html
    a. Create a container for all elements with appropiate classes
    b. Add another div container for the header including logo
    c. Create another div container for the main section(i.e *form*) and submit button
    d. Create another div for the footer 
    e. Add the appropiate elements in each container
4. Add the styling with a mobile first approach from top elements to bottom
5. Add the functionality of the form in javascript.
6. Test and fix potential bugs.
